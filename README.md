This project was made following a tutorial from udemy for the display of the TVSHOWS

It helped me to handle API calls using a popular API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ where all the movies and series list are taken

The project as for the fisrt commit will just display a movie which will be the most trending movie at the time.

For the next step, I intend to also display trending series, enable the user to choose the language his one to use and switch between movies and series.
